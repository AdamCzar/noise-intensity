# noise-intensity
Measure signal noise as a function of laser intensity.

This software aims to measure the noise in an acquired signal while the laser intensity is varied. The signal comes from a detector such as a photodiode or an ultrafast atomic force microscope. The signal is fed from the detector into a Zurich Instruments device (in this case a UHFLI lock-in amplifier) and the data is acquired via the scope module. The laser intensity is varied by turning a half-waveplate in a half-waveplate and polarizer combination. It is turned with a motorized ThorLabs rotation stage.
